# Wizdle.Web

> [!IMPORTANT]
> currently Work in Progress - as I plan to look into the new Blazor framework & dotnet Aspire for deployments on Azure (not completely happy with this approach so far....)

> [!NOTE]
> As of 16/12/25 - Aspire now supports Docker containers, which allows Wizdle to deploy to other platforms. Check out the `make` commands for easy deployments.
